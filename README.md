Project Summary:
CA-INFEWS model. California's water supply in the Central Valley faces uncertainty in the face of climate change driven shifts. These shifts create a situation where the existing infrastructure and resources are insufficient to meet demands. Research into CAâ€™s food-energy-water systems (FEWS) will analyze different climate scenarios to identify sustainable management decision pathways that impact resilience, vulnerability, and risk. Integrated modeling of California's water system from its headwaters in the Sierra Nevadas through its urban and agricultural sectors in the Central Valley will create the nexus of the FEWS model. 

Scope of ecosystem service valuation. The biophysical water models can be translated into powerful decision making tools through the integration of ecosystem goods and services (EGS). My research will focus on quantifying Recreational EGS in CA's wildlands, specifically the National Parks and National Forests in the Sierra Nevada, under alternative land and fire management and climate scenarios. 


Project Objectives:
Formally assess EGS values of park managers and visitors
 - Valuation: Flood regulation, recreation, fire control, and more.

Methodology:
 - Travel Cost Model
    - Zonal, Individual, or Random Utility
